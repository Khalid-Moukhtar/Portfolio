### MakeYourMaps: Custom Map Solution

**Description:**  
MakeYourMaps is a custom map solution designed to provide users with accurate and real-time geographic information. The project aims to enhance navigation and exploration experiences by allowing users to create personalized maps with advanced features similar to Google Maps.

**Role:**  
As a Product Manager, I played a key role in the development and enhancement of MakeYourMaps. My responsibilities included:

- **Market Research:** Conducted extensive market research to identify existing mapping solutions, assess their strengths and weaknesses, and identify opportunities for innovation and differentiation.
- **User Surveys and Feedback:** Designed and conducted user surveys to gather insights into user preferences, pain points, and frustrations while using existing mapping apps.
- **Feature Development:** Based on user research, discovered that a significant pain point was fake reviews, leading to the proposal of a "Fake Review Buster" feature to enhance trust and reliability.
- **User Stories and OKRs:** Created detailed user stories and defined Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) to align the team’s efforts with the project’s goals.
- **Validation and Iteration:** Conducted user research to validate the proposed solution and assumptions, iterating on the concept based on feedback and findings.
- **Backlog Management and Wireframing:** Developed and maintained a product backlog, prioritizing features and improvements. Created wireframes to visualize the user interface and functionality of the proposed solution, facilitating discussions with stakeholders and the development team.

**Technologies Used:**  
- **Tools:** ArcGIS for GIS data integration, Google Maps API for benchmarking, and Trello for task management.

**Key Features:**
- **Custom Map Creation:** Allows users to create personalized maps with custom markers, routes, and points of interest (POI).
- **Real-Time Traffic Updates:** Provides users with live traffic conditions and alternative routes to avoid congestion.
- **Route Optimization:** Offers optimized routes for various modes of transportation, including driving, cycling, and walking.
- **Points of Interest (POI):** Displays nearby attractions, restaurants, and services with user reviews and ratings.
- **Fake Review Buster:** A feature designed to identify and reduce the impact of fake reviews, enhancing user trust and decision-making.

**Challenges:**  
- **Data Accuracy:** Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of GIS data to provide users with precise mapping information was a key challenge.

**Impact/Results:**  
- Developed a functional prototype that demonstrated the potential to compete with existing mapping solutions, receiving positive feedback for its user-friendly interface and innovative features.

**Current Status:**  
Completed as a course project, with opportunities for further development and refinement based on user feedback and market trends.
