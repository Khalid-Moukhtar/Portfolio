During the golden age of Egyptian cinema, particularly in the 1950s, it was the world's third-largest film producer ([We See You Magazine](https://www.weseeyoumagazine.com/feature/the-rise-of-egyptian-cinema)).

## The Rising Demand for Zombie Genre Movies

Zombie movies, with their unique blend of horror, adventure, and social commentary, have captivated audiences worldwide. The Middle East, with its youthful and diverse population, is no exception to this trend. Films like "World War Z" and series such as "The Walking Dead" have shown that there's a growing appetite for the zombie genre globally, and the Middle East is keen to be part of this excitement ([Gulf News](https://gulfnews.com/entertainment/hollywood/the-evolution-of-zombie-movies-1.2305760)).

Zombie films offer more than just thrills; they provide a platform to explore deep societal themes like survival, resilience, and human nature.
