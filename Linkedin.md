Case Study: Enhancing LinkedIn’s Job Search with a Preferred Language Filter
________________________________________
1. Problem Statement
LinkedIn is a leading platform for global career opportunities, yet it lacks a vital feature for connecting multilingual professionals with businesses seeking specific language skills.
•	For Job Seekers:
Multilingual professionals often struggle to find roles that match their language proficiency, resulting in irrelevant job postings and a less efficient job search experience.
•	For Businesses:
Employers looking to hire candidates with specific language skills face challenges in reaching the right talent pool. This can lead to longer hiring cycles and difficulty filling critical roles, especially in global markets.
By bridging this gap, LinkedIn can enhance its value proposition for both job seekers and businesses.

•	For Job Seekers:
Quickly find jobs tailored to their language proficiency, reducing search time and improving the relevance of results.

Attract the right candidates by tagging job postings with required languages, ensuring better matches and reducing hiring inefficiencies.
